          <p className="about-card-text">At Havya Jewelry, we believe that jewelry is not just something you wearâ€”it's something you feel. It's a reflection of who you are, where you come from, and the beauty you carry within. Havya blends the soulful charm of Indian tradition with the ease and edge of modern fashionâ€”making every piece a graceful bridge between the past and the present.</p>
          <p className="about-card-text">Our collections are curated with deep intention: to bring you jewelry that's stylish, skin-friendly, and affordableâ€”crafted to embrace every mood, every moment, and every woman.</p>

          <h2 className="about-card-title">Our Story â€“ Born from Simplicity, Grown with Purpose</h2>
          <p className="about-card-text">Havya was born not in a boardroom, but in a moment of curiosity and quiet ambition. As a student, I saw something many of us feel but rarely voiceâ€”the desire to look and feel confident without spending a fortune. Friends and classmates would admire jewelry, hesitate, and walk away because it was too expensive, too harsh on the skin, or too far from their style.</p>
          <p className="about-card-text">That's when it beganâ€”just a few pieces, sold to students at pocket-friendly prices, chosen with care. And those few pieces? They sparked something bigger than expected. Compliments turned into conversations. Conversations turned into orders. A quiet idea began to blossom.</p>
          <p className="about-card-text">With zero pretense and a lot of heart, Havya Jewelry officially came to life in October 2024. Since then, we've grown into a trusted small business, serving customers across India, hosting over 15+ offline stalls, and fulfilling over 100 orders with love, consistency, and style.</p>

Our bestsellers include anti-tarnish stainless steel jewelry with rhodium platingâ€”gentle on skin, long-lasting in shine, and resistant to allergies that many women face with artificial jewelry.</p>
          <p className="about-card-text">Alongside these, we offer silver oxidized, gold-plated, and everyday minimal pieces that elevate your style without elevating your budget. Our collections blend Indian aesthetics with contemporary eleganceâ€”carefully selected to match every outfit, occasion, and personality.</p>
