Comprehensive Review Plan for backend/Server.js

1. Security:
- Ensure all authentication and authorization checks are robust.
- Validate inputs thoroughly to prevent injection or malformed data.
- Secure handling of sensitive data like Firebase private keys.
- Proper error messages without leaking sensitive info.

2. Error Handling:
- Consistent error responses with proper HTTP status codes.
- Catch and log errors in async functions.
- Handle edge cases like missing data or invalid formats.

3. Performance:
- Optimize database queries and avoid unnecessary calls.
- Efficient handling of file uploads and deletions.
- Use lean queries where possible to reduce overhead.

4. Code Quality and Best Practices:
- Use consistent code style and formatting.
- Remove commented-out or redundant code.
- Modularize code if possible for better maintainability.
- Use environment variables securely and validate their presence.
- Improve readability and maintainability of middleware and route handlers.

5. Specific Issues Noted:
- Repeated token verification in some routes; consider middleware reuse.
- Potential race conditions in stock updates.
- Image deletion path handling may need validation.
- Self-ping interval comment mismatch (1 min vs 5 min).
- Use of deprecated mongoose options (if any).
- Ensure all async calls are awaited properly.
